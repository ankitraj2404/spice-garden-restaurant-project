# spice-garden-restaurant-project
Spice Garden is a fully responsive restaurant website designed as part of my Java Full Stack Development with Gen AI course at NIIT. Users can explore the menu with category filters, place food orders, and book tables online. The project focuses on real-time interactivity using DOM manipulation, form validation, and JSON-based data storage.
